    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a widely used technique for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) using a linear equation. Its primary objective is to find the best-fitting linear model that describes this relationship. Linear regression is commonly employed for tasks like predicting numerical values and understanding the relationships between variables.\n",

    "## How Linear Regression Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "- In simple linear regression, you have one independent variable (feature) and one dependent variable (target).\n",
    "- The model is represented as a straight line: \\(y = mx + b\\), where:\n",
    "  - \\(y\\) is the target.\n",
    "  - \\(x\\) is the feature.\n",
    "  - \\(m\\) is the slope (coefficient).\n",
    "  - \\(b\\) is the y-intercept.\n",
    "- The goal is to find the best values of \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual data points. This is often achieved using the least squares method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "- In multiple linear regression, you have multiple independent variables (features) and one dependent variable (target).\n",
    "- The model is represented as: \\(y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \\ldots + b_nx_n\\), where:\n",
    "  - \\(y\\) is the target.\n",
    "  - \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) are the features.\n",
    "  - \\(b_0, b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n\\) are the coefficients.\n",
    "- The goal is to find the best values of the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fitting the Model**\n",
    "   - To fit a linear regression model, you typically use a dataset with known values for both the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "   - You calculate the coefficients (slopes and intercept) that minimize the loss function, often the sum of squared errors, between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Making Predictions**\n",
    "   - Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new or unseen data. You simply plug the values of the independent variables into the linear equation to predict the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - You can assess the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (coefficient of determination), and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumptions of Linear Regression**\n",
    "   - Linear regression assumes:\n",
    "     - That the relationship between variables is linear.\n",
    "     - That the errors (residuals) are normally distributed.\n",
    "     - That the variance of the errors is constant (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "     - That the independent variables are not highly correlated (no multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, and it has many variations and extensions, including ridge regression, lasso regression, and logistic regression, which are used for different types of problems and data.\n"
